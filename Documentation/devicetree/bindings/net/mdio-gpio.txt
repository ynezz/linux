MDIO on GPIOs

Currently defined compatibles:
- virtual,gpio-mdio

MDC, MDIO and optionaly MDO lines connected to GPIO controllers are listed in
the gpios property as described in section VIII.1 in the following order:

MDC, MDIO, MDO (optional)

Optional properties:

- reset-gpios: Must contain a GPIO specifier, referring to the GPIO pin
  connected to the MDIO reset pin
- reset-duration : Reset duration in milliseconds.
- reset-active-high: If present then the reset sequence using the GPIO
  specified in the "reset-gpios" property is reversed (H=reset state,
  L=operation state).

Note: Each gpio-mdio bus should have an alias correctly numbered in "aliases"
node.

Example:

aliases {
	mdio-gpio0 = &mdio0;
};

mdio0: mdio {
	compatible = "virtual,mdio-gpio";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	gpios = <&qe_pio_a 11
		 &qe_pio_c 6>;
};
